                <span className="font-bold">Chapter 4: Narrative Text</span>
                <p className="mb-3">A Narrative Text is a type of text that tells a story. It can be a real or fictional event that aims to entertain the reader or teach a moral lesson. Narrative texts are commonly found in folk tales, legend, fables, fairy tales, and personal experiences. The story often follows a chronological sequence and includes a moral or message for the readers.</p>
                <div className="border my-4"></div>
                <span className="font-medium">1. Folk Tales</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Folk tales are traditional stories passed down orally from one generation to another. These stories often come from local cultures and reflect the values, beliefs, and customs of a society. They are usually anonymous and evolve over time, with different versions existing in different regions. Folk tales typically feature common people, supernatural elements, and lessons about life, such as the importance of honesty, courage, or kindness. An example is *"The Legend of Malin Kundang"* from Indonesia.</p>
                <span className="font-medium">2. Fairy Tales</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Fairy tales are fictional stories that often begin with "Once upon a time" and involve magical creatures, talking animals, and enchantments. They are usually set in a faraway kingdom and include elements of fantasy such as fairies, witches, giants, or dragons. The main purpose of fairy tales is to entertain children while subtly teaching moral values. A fairy tale often ends with a “happily ever after.” Famous examples include *"Cinderella"*, *"Snow White"*, and *"Hansel and Gretel"*.</p>
                <span className="font-medium">3. Legends and Myths</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Legends are semi-true stories, rooted in historical facts but embellished with imaginative details over time. They often explain how a place was formed or how a hero achieved greatness. Legends usually involve real people or events but are romanticized to inspire and educate. Myths, on the other hand, are ancient stories that explain natural phenomena, the creation of the world, or the origins of gods and humans. Myths often come from religious or cultural beliefs and involve divine beings or powerful forces of nature. An example of a legend is *"The Legend of Tangkuban Perahu"*, while a myth might be "The Greek Myth of Hercules."
                </p>
                <span className="font-medium">4. Fables</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Fables are short stories that teach a moral or lesson, often using animals as the main characters. These animals are anthropomorphized, meaning they behave and speak like humans. Fables are very simple and direct, making them suitable for children. At the end of a fable, there is usually a clear statement of the moral lesson. The most famous fables were written by Aesop, such as *"The Tortoise and the Hare"*, which teaches the value of perseverance and patience.</p>
                <span className="font-medium">5. Personal Stories</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Personal stories are narratives based on real-life experiences of individuals. They can be written in the first person and often reflect a memorable event, lesson, or emotional moment in someone’s life. These stories help readers understand and relate to the writer’s feelings, struggles, or achievements. Personal stories can be found in memoirs, diaries, blogs, or autobiographical essays. An example might be *"My First Day at School"* or "How I Overcame My Fear of Speaking in Public."</p>
                <span className="font-medium">6. Historical Recounts</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Historical recounts a re narrative texts that retell significant events from the past, usually based on true events. These texts focus on who was involved, what happened, where it took place, and why it was important. Historical recounts may describe wars, revolutions, discoveries, or important figures. While based on facts, they can be written in an engaging, story-like format to help readers better understand history. An example is a story about *"The Fall of the Berlin Wall"* or "The Struggle for Indonesian Independence."</p>

                <span className="font-medium mt-4">Language Features</span>
                <p>Narratiuve texts have spesific language characteristics, such as:</p>
                <span className="font-medium">1. Past Tense</span>
                <p className="mb-2">We use narrative tenses to talk about the past. We can use them to tell a story or to describe past events, including personal anecdotes. The four narrative tenses are the past simple [simple past tense], past continuous, past perfect and past perfect continuous and one or more of these can be used in a sentence. The story describes evnet that already happened. e.g., “lived, went, saw, was, had”. (“The princess lived in a castle”).</p>
                <span className="font-medium">2. Action Verbs</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Action verbs describe physical or mental actions that the characters perform. These verbs help bring the story to life by showing what the characters do, feel, or think. e.g., “ran, shouted, saw, was, had”. (“The wolf ran quickly”).</p>
                <span className="font-medium">3. Time Connectives</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Narrative texts use time connectives (also known as sequencing words) to organize events in a logical order. These words show when something happens and help the story flow smoothly from beginning to end. Help organize the story timeline. e.g., “Once upon a time…”, “then, suddenly”, “finally”, “in the end”
                </p>
                <span className="font-medium">4. Dialogue</span>
                <p className="mb-2">Narrative texts often include dialogue to make the characters more expressive and realistic. Dialogue helps to reveal character personalities, show relationship between characthers, move story forward. Dialogue can be written in two forms: Direct Speech: Quoting the exact words of a character using quotation marks. "I will never give up!" shouted the boy, Indirect Speech: Reporting what someone said without quoting their exact words. The boy said that he would never give up.</p>

                    <p className="mb-2">Salsabila Khairunnisa was born in 2003 is an Indonesian environmental activist. Aged 15, she co-founded The Jaga Rimba youth movement which aims to ight deforestation and exploitation in Indonesia. In 2020, she was nominated to be one of the BBC’s 100 Women Award.</p>
                    <span className="font-medium">Complication:</span>
                    <p className="mb-2">Jaga Rimba is closely connected to the community who lived at Laman Kinipan, who was evicted from the village in 2018 by a palm oil company. The business PT Sawit Mandiri Lestari (SML) claimed they had the right to use the land in the community to grow palm. They evicted the villagers, resulting in famine, as well as affecting the community of orangutans who lived in the area. Jaga Rimba campaigns to ensure that the indigenous people of the Kinipan Forest, one of Borneo’s last rainforests, not to lose their land.</p>
                    <span className="font-medium">Resolution:</span>
                    <p className="mb-2">Khairunnisa, who is inspired by other climate activists such as Sweden’s Greta Thunberg and Mitzi Jonelle Tan from the Philippines, said Jaga Rimba has advised student campaigns against deforestation on Sumatra island, in Kalimantan and Indonesia’s easternmost region of Papua. Recent campaigns have targeted Indonesia’s plans to develop a giant farm on Borneo island to avoid food shortages, and a job creation bill passed by parliament in October that critics say could weaken environmental standards. Khairunnisa is increasingly being recognized for her climate activism and last month was listed as one of the BBC’s 100 inspiring and inluential women for 2020.</p>
