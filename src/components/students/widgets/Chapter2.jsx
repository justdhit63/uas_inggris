                <p className="font-bold mb-2">Types of Waste</p>
                <p>There are several types of waste that people encounter in daily life, each with distinct characteristics and environmental impacts. Organic waste refers to biodegradable materials that originate from living organisms, such as food scraps, fruit peels, and dried leaves. These materials naturally decompose and can be turned into compost to support plant growth. In contrast, inorganic waste includes non-biodegradable items like plastics, metals, and glass, which take hundreds of years to break down and often contribute to long-term pollution. Another important category is recyclable waste, which consists of materials like paper, aluminum cans, specific types of plastic, and cardboard. These items can be processed and reused, thereby reducing landfill waste. Hazardous waste poses significant threats to both human health and the environment; it includes dangerous substances like batteries, chemicals, and pesticides. Solid waste refers to non-liquid waste generated from homes, businesses, and industries, such as household trash, packaging, and construction debris. On the other hand, liquid waste includes substances in liquid form, such as wastewater, oil, and detergents, usually produced by households and factories. Electronic waste, also known as e-waste, includes discarded electronic devices such as old computers, phones, and televisions. Lastly, household waste refers to the general waste produced in homes, including leftover food, containers, and cleaning products.</p>

                <p className="font-bold mb-2">Verbs of the Five Sense</p>
                <p>To describe environmental situations more vividly, students are encouraged to use verbs related to the five senses. These verbs help add detail and clarity to their observations. The verb "see" is used to describe visible elements, such as in the sentence “I see a pile of plastic waste.” The verb "hear" helps describe sounds, for example, “I hear the buzzing of flies around the trash.” "Smell" can describe odors from waste, like “I smell something rotten near the garbage bin.” Although "taste" is rarely used in environmental contexts, it may still apply when discussing contaminated food or water. Finally, the verb "feel" is useful in describing physical sensations or textures, such as “The air feels dirty and humid near the landfill.” These verbs help students express their experiences more clearly and effectively.</p>

                <p className="font-bold mb-2">Evironmental Terms</p>
                <p>To improve environmental awareness, students are introduced to several key environmental terms. Pollution refers to the presence of harmful substances in the environment, while garbage is the general term for waste produced from daily human activities. A waste bank is a community initiative where recyclable materials are collected and exchanged for goods or money. A landfill is a site where solid waste is buried under layers of soil. Waste sorting refers to the process of separating different types of waste before recycling or disposal. Compost is organic material that has decomposed and is used as fertilizer. Recycling is the process of converting waste into reusable material. Lastly, environmentally friendly describes actions or products that do not harm the environment.</p>

                <p className="font-bold mb-2">Language Features</p>
                <p>This unit also emphasizes the use of specific language features to describe environmental issues effectively. One of them is the use of adjective phrases, which typically consist of an adjective and modifiers. These phrases help provide detailed descriptions, such as in the expressions “a large blue plastic bottle,” “extremely toxic waste,” or “very smelly garbage.” Students also focus on understanding parts of speech, especially adjectives, which modify nouns and help clarify meaning. Examples include “polluted river,” “recyclable waste,” and “dangerous substance.” Additionally, students are guided to use the simple present tense when describing general facts or daily actions related to waste and the environment, such as “Plastic takes hundreds of years to decompose” or “People throw their waste into the trash bins.”</p>

                <p className="font-bold mb-2">Summary of Learning</p>
                <p>In summary, this unit aims to build students’ environmental awareness by teaching them the language necessary to identify and discuss various types of waste. Through activities in listening, speaking, reading, viewing, writing, and presenting, students develop their ability to express environmental ideas clearly. The language focus includes vocabulary on waste types, environmental terms, and sensory verbs, as well as grammatical features such as adjective phrases and the simple present tense. The main genre practiced is descriptive text, both spoken and written, allowing students to articulate their environmental observations and concerns effectively.</p>
